You're a HECU soldier. Your squad successfully infiltrated the Black Mesa Research Facility and entered the Dormitories area. So far nothing out the ordinary, however some marines reported seeing weird things. The briefing was... well, very brief. An incident happened, and you must contain the situation. That includes the elimination of the local personnel.

Your friend Kevin serves as a radioman in this mission. He's someone you can always rely on.

The engineer can help you get through the locked doors, but he's stuck in the elevator. You need to find and rescue him, otherwise you can't proceed on your mission.
